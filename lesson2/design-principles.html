                The Brigham Young University mobile homepage is a great example of Hicks' law in action.
                Hicks' law describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices: increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time.
                This webpage has only a couple of possible targets to click, greatly reducing the strain of descision for the user.
                The page is not overwhelming, instead it is very clear what the user's options are immedietly after the page load.

            <p>
                The Apartments.com homepage is a clear example of a positive use of Fitts' law.
                Fitts' law shows that the closer and larger the element is, the more easily a user can interact with it.
                The apartments.com use of Fitts' law becomes apparent when we look at the primary element on the page, the search bar.
                The search bar is just a single element, but it takes up the entire width of the page and has a lot of padding.
                The user's attention is immedietly drawn and it is very easy to interact with this element, which leads to the user spending more time on the site.

                <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>

            <p>
                Netflix, unsurprisingly, has used the rule of thirds in their mobile layout for their browse page.
                The Netflix browse page is made up of rows or carousels that the user can scroll through to discover new content.
                The viewport shows three items out of the carousel at one time, effectively dividing the page into three columns.
                Because of our understanding of the rule of thirds, we know that this is an aesthetically pleasing design.
